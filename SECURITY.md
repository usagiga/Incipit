## Reporting a Vulnerability

Once you found undiscovered vulnerability, but there's no issues, no pull requests, no [Dependabot alerts](https://github.com/usagiga/Incipit/network/alerts), the vulnerability should have been undiscovered.
If that were to happen, please share it on [issues](https://github.com/usagiga/Incipit/issues) with a `vulnerability` tag or make [pull request](https://github.com/usagiga/Incipit/pulls).
